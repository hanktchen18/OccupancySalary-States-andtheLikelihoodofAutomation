This project analyzes the relationship between the probability of job automation, state GDP, and average employee salaries using data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and a 2017 research paper by Frey and Osbourne. The key findings indicate that while state GDP has minimal impact on salaries, the likelihood of automation negatively correlates with salary levels. Automation increases job insecurity and disproportionately affects lower-paying jobs, with automation's impact on gender wage gaps remaining inconclusive. The analysis underscores the need for the Department of Labor to address the vulnerabilities of workers in highly automatable jobs and continue efforts to close the gender wage gap.
